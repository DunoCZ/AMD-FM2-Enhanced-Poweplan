# AMD FM2+ Enhanced Poweplan

## Description
Hello folks!
Welcome on this repo, this modified balanced powerplan should help you achieve better performance, idle usage (lower), idle clocks (also lower), handling single-threaded processes, and maybe lowering temps and power consumption.
Tested on FM2+ AMD Athlon X4 870K clocked at 4.3Ghz with 8GB 2133Mhz RAM in dual channel.

## Disclaimer
This powerplan SHOULD (no gurantee) do same thing on FM2(non plus), AM3 and AM3+ but am not sure, I don't own these platforms.
This powerplan WAS NOT tested on laptops, so I don't also gurantee that.
This powerplan is without gurantee so if it doesn't work then I'm sorry at least it's free.
